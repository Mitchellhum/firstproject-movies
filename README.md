# firstproject-movies

Hi,

Welcome to my very first repository and project.
Before you take a look at my files - or even try to rebuild the project itself - a little bit of background information is needed.

### How long have I been learning React/FastAPI/Python for?
React - <2 weeks
FastAPI - 1 hour youtube course
Python - 1 month

### Why this project?
I build this project to get familiar with React and put everything I learned from my courses in practice. Learning all the elements of React is fun, of course, but how to combine the different languages to make something that works is a different story.

### What do I need to run this project?
npm, Nodejs, mongodb, uvicorn, fastapi, motor (please contact me if I forgot anything) 

TODO:
- Add comments
- Add trailers/pictures
- Increase movies per page to 10
- Pagination doesnt work well after 10 pages, find sollution
- Shorten code, improve readability
- Add ability to edit a movie

Current points for the future:
- IMPROVE in CSS
- Learn to solve more complex issues with React
- Deep dive in Git(hub)
- Practice practice practice

Hope you like what I made :)
